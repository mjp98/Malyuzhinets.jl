An experimental package to evaluate the Malyuzhinets/Maliuzhinets function, a special function arising in wedge diffraction problems.

The methods are mainly based on the paper

> Aidi, M. & Lavergnat, J.. (1996). Approximation of the Maliuzhinets function. Journal of Electromagnetic Waves and Applications. 10. 1395-1411. 10.1163/156939396X00153.

This package is a work in progress, with the intention being to provide methods to help construct fast approximations as well as provide general algorithms.
